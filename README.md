# Estimation-and-Comparison-of-Low-Input-and-Conventional-Production-Functions-Swiss-Application

This repositery provides the code used for the estimation and comparison of the low-input and conventional production functions of Swiss wheat producers. Farm data being confidential, data cannot be made publicly available.

The considered model enhances several features:
  - A non-linear production function with a damage abatement part to account for the protective role of pesticides;
  - A control function to account for input endogeneity in agricultural production functions;
  - An endogenous regime switching approach to account for the selection bias when considering farmer's production system choice (e.g., conventional versus low-input).
